### **Project 1: Personal Webpage**

**Goal:**
Create a personal portfolio webpage using HTML5 and CSS that showcases my skills, experience, and contact information. This webpage introduces me, providing potential employers with insight into my work and background and links to my social media profiles (e.g., GitHub and LinkedIn).

**Technologies Used:**
- HTML5 for content structure
- CSS for design and presentation
- Bootstrap for enhanced, responsive styling

**Implementation:**
The project involved designing several pages: a homepage, resume, project listing, and a contact form. I used Bootstrap templates for a consistent look and applied custom CSS to add unique styling. The responsive layout ensured the webpage was accessible across multiple devices and screen sizes.

**Improvements:**
- Enhanced the "About Me" section with additional content and a professional tone.
- Refined the contact form to improve user experience by adding validations and a more intuitive UI.

### **Project 2: Resume Webpage**

**Goal:**
Develop a dedicated webpage highlighting my professional experience, education, and skills in an easily readable and visually attractive format.

**Technologies Used:**
- HTML5 and CSS for the structure and styling
- Bootstrap for layout consistency

**Implementation:**
I created a resume page that presents my work experience and education in card-like sections styled with Bootstrap components. The page includes download options for the resume's HTML and PDF versions.

**Improvements:**
- Modified the structure of the experience and education sections for better clarity.
- Improved styling with subtle color themes, making each section distinct and consistent.

### **Project 3: JavaScript-Based Statistical Analysis App**

**Goal:**
Design a JavaScript-based app that takes three numbers as inputs and provides fundamental statistical analysis, such as the maximum, minimum, mean, median, and range.

**Technologies Used:**
- HTML5 for the form and results placeholders
- JavaScript for calculation logic
- Bootstrap for layout and styling
- Custom CSS for a Halloween theme

**Implementation:**
The app uses a form for users to input three numbers, then calculates and displays various statistics. JavaScript was used to handle all calculations and validation checks. I included Bootstrap elements to ensure consistency and a custom CSS Halloween theme to make it visually unique.

**Improvements:**
- Added validation to ensure users only enter valid numbers.
- Suggested adding an extensive input option to handle more than three numbers.
- Plan to include additional computations like mode, variance, and standard deviation for more comprehensive analysis.

### **Project 4: Tic Tac Toe Game Using jQuery**

**Goal:**
Develop a functional Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. Players should be able to choose between "first to three wins" or "first to ten wins" using a button.

**Technologies Used:**
- HTML for content and structure
- CSS for styling, including custom themes
- JavaScript and jQuery for game logic and user interaction
- Bootstrap for UI components

**Implementation:**
The game was designed to be interactive, indicating which player is active. The winning threshold (first to 3 or 10) was implemented via buttons that let the user decide before starting the game. jQuery was used to streamline DOM manipulation and improve user experience.

**Improvements:**
- Added button functionality for the user to choose between three or ten wins as the winning condition.
- Enhanced game experience with an updated Halloween-themed CSS, creating a fun and visually distinct gaming environment.

**Summary**

Each project builds upon the last, showcasing my ability to create interactive, user-friendly web applications using modern web development techniques. The goal has been to apply best practices in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap while continuously improving user experience and functionality. I plan to expand these projects further by adding more features and continuous refinements based on user feedback.
